## Feedback Items

| # | Area | Feedback | Type | Priority |
|---|------|----------|------|----------|
| 1 | **User Tracking** | Treating all users as new clients is acceptable for initial campaign. Future need: track what returning users repeatedly check to understand what they're explaining to *their* clients. | Future requirement | Phase 2+ |
| 2 | **Evidence Display** | Some evidence items require multiple sub-items. Example: "Electricity" should show solar, wind, *and* two nuclear power plants in Kyushu (for power stability). | Clarification | MVP |
| 3 | **Infrastructure Plan** | Simplify to just highlight roads being built/expanded. Make them easy to click. | Simplification | MVP |
| 4 | **Property Images** | Unclear where property images/renderings should appear in the flow. Needs placement decision. | Open question | MVP |
