## Feedback Items

| # | Area | Feedback | Type | Priority |
|---|------|----------|------|----------|
| 1 | **Why Kumamoto — Strategic Location** | "Strategic Location" pillar needs to show international airline routes from Aso Kumamoto Airport directly on our map interface. This is evidence that Kumamoto has direct regional connectivity — reinforcing why semiconductor companies chose this location. | Requirement | MVP |
| 2 | **Airline Route Data** | Aso Kumamoto Airport has 7 international routes: Seoul Incheon, Busan Gimhae, Shanghai Pudong (service suspended), Taiwan Taoyuan, Tainan Airport, Kaohsiung International, Hong Kong International (service suspended). Routes connect to Korea, China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. | New content | MVP |
| 3 | **Map Visualization** | Airline routes should be displayed on the MOHA-MAP map interface (not as a separate static image). Reference image shows route lines from Aso Kumamoto Airport to each destination airport with pin markers. | Design direction | MVP |
| 4 | **Fits Existing Flow** | This supports the "Why Kumamoto" step (Step 1/2) under the 4 pillars established in v2 feedback: water, electricity, existing semiconductor infrastructure, and **strategic location**. Airline routes are the primary evidence for the strategic location pillar. | Clarification | MVP |
